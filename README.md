# node-las
LAS toolkit for working with Lidar data in Node

This is very much a work in progress.
The long-term goal is to create a [libLAS] or [LAStools] -esque toolkit written entirely in Javascript.
Thanks to the folks who built [jBinary], this may not be an impossible goal.

The work on this is being done in the dev branch. The master will be updated when there is 
a usable version of the program.
