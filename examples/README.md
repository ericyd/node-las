# Node LAS examples

There are already some excellent LAS/LAZ viewers online. See <http://potree.org/> and <http://plas.io/>.

The purpose of this is not to reinvent the wheel but to demonstrate how this particular library can be
integrated with other tools such as [TurfJS](http://turfjs.org/) and [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org)
to make a functional (if basic) application.

Note that this example is essentially a submodule, and has it's own dependencies distinct from node-las.
Run `npm install` in this directory to install the necessary dependencies.
